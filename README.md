This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ada related to integer overflow. The `Check_Range` function checks if a number is within a specific range (10-20). However, if an Integer that exceeds the maximum value (`Integer'Last`) is provided,  an overflow can occur leading to unexpected results.  The solution shows how to handle this situation more robustly using exception handling or by checking for potential overflow before the comparison.
